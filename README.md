# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

This game features es6, html5 and css3, Jasmine.
Main topics: unit tests, Behavior-Driven JavaScript

## To Run: ##

Use a local server such as XAMPP or simply install python and from command line execute:

* on Windows `py -m http.server <portNumber>`
* on Mac or Linux `python -m SimpleHTTPServer <portNumber>`

If you are using Chrome you could also install the extension [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en).
